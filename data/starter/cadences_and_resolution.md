# Cadences, Resolution, and Voice Leading

Music is fundamentally about tension and release. A melody that never settles, a chord that never resolves — these feel incomplete, unsatisfying, like a question with no answer. Cadences are the moments where music punctuates itself, and understanding them gives you conscious control over one of the most powerful tools in harmony: the ability to make a listener feel arrival, suspension, surprise, or finality.

This reference covers the main cadence types, the voice leading principles that make them work, and the psychological reasons certain progressions feel resolved while others keep us waiting.

## What Is a Cadence?

A cadence is a harmonic formula that signals the end — or a temporary pause — in a musical phrase. Think of cadences like punctuation: a perfect authentic cadence is a period, a half cadence is a comma, a deceptive cadence is an em-dash that throws you off mid-sentence.

Cadences derive their power from two sources:

1. **Functional harmony** — the built-in tension of certain intervals (especially the tritone) that demand resolution
2. **Cultural conditioning** — centuries of Western music have trained our ears to expect certain chord progressions to resolve in certain ways

Understanding both layers helps you use cadences deliberately, whether you want to meet expectations or subvert them.

## The Cadence Types

### Perfect Authentic Cadence (PAC)

**Formula:** V–I (or V7–I), both chords in root position, melody ending on scale degree 1

The perfect authentic cadence is the strongest, most conclusive cadence in tonal music. It creates an unmistakable sense of arrival. When a piece ends with a PAC, the listener has no doubt it is over.

**Examples:**
- In C major: G–C (or G7–C)
- In G major: D–G (or D7–G)
- In A minor: E–Am (or E7–Am) — note the raised 7th (G#) to create the leading tone

The V7–I version is even stronger because the dominant seventh chord contains a tritone (between the 3rd and 7th of the chord) that creates intense tension before resolving. In G7–C, the tritone between B and F resolves: B moves up a half step to C, F moves down a half step to E.

The "perfect" designation requires both chords in root position and scale degree 1 in the melody. If those conditions aren't met, you have an imperfect authentic cadence.

### Imperfect Authentic Cadence (IAC)

**Formula:** V–I (various inversions or non-tonic melody note), or sometimes vii°–I

The imperfect authentic cadence moves from dominant function to tonic, but something about it is incomplete — either a chord is inverted, the melody ends on scale degree 3 or 5, or the leading chord is the diminished seventh (vii°) instead of V.

**Examples:**
- In C major: G/B–C (V with third in bass moving to I) — the resolution is clear but lighter
- In D major: A–D, but with F# in the melody instead of D
- In E minor: D#dim–Em (vii°–i) — a slightly more angular, abrupt resolution

IACs are useful for phrase endings within a section where you want to close but not fully conclude. They feel like a breath rather than a full stop. Pop and folk music use them constantly to keep phrases flowing before the final PAC.

### Half Cadence (HC)

**Formula:** Any chord–V, ending on the dominant

A half cadence ends on V, leaving the phrase harmonically open. It's the musical equivalent of a question mark — the phrase feels suspended, and the listener expects the music to continue.

**Examples:**
- In C major: I–V (C–G), ii–V (Dm–G), IV–V (F–G)
- In Bb major: Cm–F (ii–V), Eb–F (IV–V)
- In A minor: Am–E (i–V) — again, the major V chord (with G#) creates a stronger pull

The most common setup for a half cadence is the **ii–V** motion, which is the backbone of jazz harmony. In C major, Dm7–G7 is a textbook half cadence. Jazz musicians extend this into ii7–V7–Imaj7 (the ii–V–I progression), where the half cadence is the tension that demands the final I chord.

The **Phrygian half cadence** is a special case: iv6–V in minor, where the bass moves down a half step to the dominant. In A minor, this is Dm/F–E. The descending half step in the bass gives it a particular gravity — it appears throughout Baroque music and has a somber, inevitable quality.

---

### Plagal Cadence (IV–I)

**Formula:** IV–I (subdominant to tonic)

Known as the "Amen cadence" because of its ubiquity at the end of hymns, the plagal cadence moves from the subdominant (IV) to the tonic (I). It lacks the driving tension of the authentic cadence — there's no leading tone, no tritone — which gives it a softer, more passive sense of resolution.

**Examples:**
- In C major: F–C
- In G major: C–G
- In E major: A–E

The plagal cadence feels reverential, gentle, or timeless. Its softness comes from the absence of the tritone and leading tone that power authentic cadences. Where V–I pushes, IV–I settles.

In rock and blues, **IV–I** motion is everywhere — think of the "Amen" tag at the end of a gospel song, or the way a blues turnaround often lands back on I via the IV chord. The Rolling Stones, Neil Young, and countless others lean on the plagal cadence for its grounded, unhurried feel.

A **plagal extension** adds a chord before the IV: I–IV–I, often heard as a kind of affirmation or flourish after an already-complete authentic cadence.

---

### Deceptive Cadence (V–vi)

**Formula:** V–vi (dominant resolves to the submediant instead of the tonic)

The deceptive cadence is exactly what it sounds like: a cheat. The harmony sets up a dominant chord, which makes the listener expect a tonic resolution, and then sidesteps to vi (the relative minor in major keys, or the subtonic in minor keys).

**Examples:**
- In C major: G–Am (or G7–Am)
- In F major: C–Dm (or C7–Dm)
- In D major: A–Bm

The deceptive cadence works because vi shares two notes with I (in C major, Am contains A and C, while C major contains C, E, and G — the shared notes are C). The ear partially registers the resolution but senses something is off. It creates an emotional twist — often melancholy, wistful, or surprising.

Composers use deceptive cadences to extend phrases, delay the final resolution, or inject emotional complexity. If you're writing a song and a phrase feels too tidy or predictable, dropping in a deceptive cadence before the eventual PAC adds depth.

In pop music, the deceptive cadence often sounds like an emotional gut-punch: just when you think the song has arrived, it opens back up into something unresolved.

### Picardy Third

**Formula:** Ending a minor-key passage with a major I chord (i becomes I)

The Picardy third (also spelled "Picardian") is the practice of ending a piece or section in a minor key with a major tonic chord. In A minor, instead of ending on Am, you end on A major. In D minor, instead of Dm, you close on D major.

**Examples:**
- A minor passage resolving to A major (A–C#–E instead of A–C–E)
- E minor piece ending on E major (E–G#–B instead of E–G–B)
- D minor ending on D major (D–F#–A instead of D–F–A)

The raised third (the Picardy third itself — C# in A minor, G# in E minor, F# in D minor) creates a sudden brightening after the darkness of the minor key. It can feel triumphant, transcendent, or bittersweet depending on context.

The Picardy third was especially common in Baroque music — Bach used it constantly to end chorales in minor keys. It carries a sense of resolving upward, of emerging from shadow into light. In modern usage, it can feel either archaic and formal or genuinely moving, depending on how it's framed.

### Backdoor Cadence (bVII–I)

**Formula:** bVII–I (the flat seventh chord resolving to tonic)

The backdoor cadence is a jazz and blues term for the progression bVII7–I (or bVII–I in simpler forms). In C major, that's Bb7–C. Instead of approaching the tonic from the dominant (a fifth above), you approach it from a whole step below.

**Examples:**
- In C major: Bb7–Cmaj7
- In G major: F7–Gmaj7
- In D major: C7–Dmaj7

The backdoor cadence borrows the bVII chord from the parallel minor or the Mixolydian mode. It has a bluesy, relaxed quality — there's still resolution, but it's smooth and sideways rather than the direct dominant-tonic drive of V–I. The Bb7 in C major contains the tritone Bb–E (from Mixolydian), and that E resolves naturally up to the E in the C major chord, while Bb can move down to A (the 6th of C) or stay as a 7th.

You hear backdoor cadences constantly in jazz standards, blues-inflected pop, and soul music. Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, and countless jazz arrangers use bVII–I as a sophisticated alternative to the expected V–I.

## Voice Leading

Understanding cadences is only part of the picture. Voice leading is what makes those cadences sound smooth (or intentionally rough). Voice leading refers to how individual notes within chords move from one chord to the next.

### The Core Principles

**1. Prefer stepwise motion (conjunct motion)**

Voices that move by half step or whole step are easier to sing, sound smoother, and create a sense of continuity. When a chord voice has to leap, it draws attention to itself — sometimes that's exactly what you want, but stepwise motion is the default in classical voice leading.

In a V7–I resolution in C major (G7–C):
- B (7th of G) moves up a half step to C — stepwise
- F (7th of G7) moves down a half step to E — stepwise
- D can move down a step to C or stay (as the fifth of C)
- G can stay on G (common tone)

**2. Use common tones where possible**

When two adjacent chords share a note, keep it in the same voice. This creates connection between the chords and avoids unnecessary movement.

In C major, the progression I–IV (C–F): C major (C–E–G) and F major (F–A–C) share the note C. Keep C in the same voice and move the other voices to their nearest positions.

**3. Contrary motion over parallel motion**

When two voices must move, prefer contrary motion (one goes up, one goes down) over parallel motion (both go the same direction by the same interval). Parallel fifths and parallel octaves are the classic errors in four-part writing — they cause voices to lose independence and fuse into a single color.

Example of parallel fifths to avoid: if you move from C–G in the bass and soprano to D–A, you've created parallel fifths. Instead, one voice should move contrary to or obliquely from the other.

**4. Resolve tendency tones**

Certain scale degrees carry strong directional pull:
- Scale degree 7 (the leading tone) wants to resolve up to 1
- Scale degree 4 wants to resolve down to 3
- Scale degree 6 in minor can pull downward to 5

These aren't absolute rules — you can delay or redirect tendency tones — but violating them without reason creates a sense of incompleteness or awkwardness.

### Leading Tone Resolution

The leading tone (scale degree 7) is the most important tendency tone in tonal music. It sits a half step below the tonic and creates the strongest possible pull toward resolution.

In C major, B is the leading tone. It wants to resolve to C.

In the dominant chord (G or G7), B appears as the major third. This is why the V–I progression is so strong: B resolves upward to C, and (in the case of V7) F resolves downward to E. Both movements are by half step, both are smooth, and both reinforce the tonic arrival.

**Why the harmonic minor scale matters:**
In natural minor, scale degree 7 is a whole step below 1 — this weakens the pull toward the tonic. The harmonic minor scale raises degree 7 by a half step specifically to restore the leading tone and create a strong V chord (making it major or dominant 7th rather than minor). In A minor, G is raised to G# so that E major (E–G#–B) can serve as the dominant, giving you that same half-step pull to the tonic A.

This is why you'll often see E7 in A minor contexts even though the key signature has no sharps — the G# is borrowed to create a proper leading tone.

---

### Tritone Resolution in Dominant 7th Chords

The tritone is the interval of three whole steps (or six half steps) — the augmented fourth or diminished fifth. It's the most dissonant interval in Western harmony, and it's the engine that powers dominant seventh chords.

In G7 (G–B–D–F):
- B and F form the tritone
- B (the leading tone) resolves upward by half step to C
- F (the chordal seventh) resolves downward by half step to E

When G7 resolves to C major (C–E–G), both tritone tones land on chord tones of the tonic: B→C (root) and F→E (third). This double half-step convergence is maximally efficient and satisfying.

The tritone can also resolve outward (both notes moving away from each other) instead of inward. This is what happens in the **tritone substitution** common in jazz: Db7 (Db–F–Ab–Cb) substitutes for G7 because both chords contain the same tritone (B/Cb and F), just respelled. The Db7–C resolution features the same F→E movement but Db→C instead of B→C.

Understanding tritone resolution explains why the dominant seventh chord is uniquely powerful: no other diatonic chord contains a tritone with such clean half-step resolution paths into the tonic.

## Why Some Progressions Feel Resolved and Others Don't

Resolution is partly physics (the overtone series rewards certain intervals) and partly psychology (learned expectation). Here's a breakdown of the factors:

**Harmonic distance from the tonic**
Chords built on scale degrees that share many common tones with the tonic feel close and stable. I, iii, and vi all share notes with each other. Chords built on IV, V, and ii feel more distant and create more tension.

**Presence of the leading tone**
Any chord containing scale degree 7 carries tension toward 1. The V chord contains it as its third; vii° contains it as its root. These chords feel unstable because the leading tone demands resolution.

**The tritone**
The tritone is dissonant and unstable. Any chord containing a tritone (diminished chords, dominant 7th chords) will feel like it needs to move. Chords without tritones (I, ii, iii, IV, vi) feel comparatively stable.

**Rhythmic placement**
A chord landing on a strong beat with a previous phrase's momentum feels more resolved than the same chord appearing mid-phrase. Cadences work partly because they occur at structurally important moments — the end of a phrase, the downbeat after a harmonic buildup.

**Melodic landing**
A cadence where the melody lands on scale degree 1 feels more resolved than one where the melody lands on 3 or 5. This is why the distinction between perfect and imperfect authentic cadences matters — same chords, different feeling based on where the melody ends.

## Creating Tension and Release

Tension and release is the heartbeat of music. Here are the tools for controlling it:

**Build tension with:**
- Dominant function chords (V, V7, vii°)
- Secondary dominants (V/V, V/IV — borrowing dominant function from other keys)
- Prolonged half cadences (sitting on V for multiple beats or measures)
- Chromatic alterations (raised or lowered chord tones that increase dissonance)
- Rhythmic displacement (cadence arriving off the beat)
- Register extremes (high melody notes over low bass)
- Added dissonances (7ths, 9ths, 13ths in jazz voicings)

**Release tension with:**
- Perfect authentic cadences (V7–I, both root position, melody on 1)
- Stepwise voice leading into the tonic
- Rhythmic arrival on a strong beat
- Middle register, balanced voicing
- Removal of dissonant extensions on the tonic chord

**Sustain tension with:**
- Deceptive cadences (V–vi delays the release)
- Half cadences (end on V and pause)
- Sequential progressions that avoid the tonic
- Modal mixture (borrowing from parallel minor/major creates ambiguity)

The most effective musical phrases set up tension systematically and release it either at the expected moment (satisfying) or at an unexpected moment (surprising). When a resolution is both slightly delayed and then fully delivered, it's often the most emotionally powerful option.

## Suspensions

A suspension is a note held over from a previous chord into a new chord where it becomes dissonant, followed by its resolution to a chord tone. Suspensions are among the most expressive tools in harmony because they slow down the resolution, making the arrival more satisfying.

### Sus4 Resolving to 3 (4–3 Suspension)

The most common suspension. Scale degree 4 is held over into a chord where it creates dissonance against the third, then resolves down by step to the third.

**Example in C major:**
- C major chord is approached, but F (the 4th) is held in the melody instead of E (the 3rd)
- The chord sounds like Csus4 (C–F–G) rather than C (C–E–G)
- F then resolves down to E, completing the chord

**Common in practice:**
- Gsus4–G in C major: the sus4 (C over G) resolves to B (the third of G)
- In D major: Asus4–A, where D resolves to C# over the A chord

Emotionally, the 4–3 suspension creates yearning, anticipation, and finally a sense of landing. It's everywhere in hymns, ballads, and cinematic music. The sustained dissonance makes the ear wait for the resolution, and when it comes, it's more felt because of the wait.

### Sus2 Resolving to 3 (2–3 Suspension, or Sus2)

Scale degree 2 is held in place of the third, then resolves up by step to the third.

**Example in C major:**
- Csus2 (C–D–G): D is held instead of E
- D resolves up to E, completing the C major chord

**Common in practice:**
- Dsus2–D in G major: E (the 2nd) held, then resolves to F# (the 3rd)
- Sus2 chords in open guitar tunings, where the 2nd and 5th ring freely before the 3rd arrives

Emotionally, the sus2 has a more open, ambiguous quality than the sus4. While the sus4 feels tense and pointed, the sus2 feels spacious and searching. Many guitar-based rock songs use sus2 voicings precisely for this floating, unresolved quality — they sometimes never fully resolve the suspension, leaving the chord open.

### The Emotional Logic of Suspensions

Both suspension types work on the same psychological principle: **delay makes arrival more meaningful**. By withholding the expected chord tone for even a beat or two, the suspension trains the listener's attention on the resolution. The dissonance isn't unpleasant — it's expectant. When the resolution arrives, it's experienced as relief.

This is why suspensions appear so often in emotionally climactic moments in music. A ballad that lands on Vsus4–V–I at its emotional peak is using the sus4 to wring every last drop of longing out of the moment before the final resolution.

## Putting It All Together

Here's a practical guide to applying these concepts in a real musical context. Say you're writing a song in G major and you want to create a verse that feels searching and a chorus that feels triumphant.

**Verse (tension, openness):**
- Stay away from the PAC — end phrases on half cadences (D or Am7–D)
- Use deceptive cadences (D–Em) to avoid final resolution
- Use sus4 chords (Dsus4–D) to add yearning before the half cadence
- Consider the backdoor cadence (F–G) for a bluesy, indirect approach

**Chorus (release, arrival):**
- Lead in with a strong ii–V setup (Am7–D7)
- Resolve with a PAC: D7–G, both root position, G in the melody
- Voice lead the D7–G carefully: F# (leading tone) up to G, C (chordal 7th) down to B
- Follow with a plagal cadence (C–G) to extend the feeling of resolution with warmth

**Bridge (surprise and recontextualization):**
- Use a deceptive cadence at the peak (D7–Em) to create an emotional twist
- Explore the relative minor (Em), making the return to G major feel like emergence
- End the bridge on a half cadence (D) to set up the final chorus with maximum tension

This kind of structural thinking — knowing which cadences create which emotional effects and how voice leading amplifies those effects — is what separates intentional composition from accidental harmony. Every resolution is a choice, and every choice communicates something.
