# Chord Progressions by Genre

A practical reference for common harmonic patterns across genres, written for working musicians. Each section covers the progressions you'll encounter most often, why they work, and how they actually sound in real keys.

---

## Blues

Blues harmony is built on tension. The whole genre sits on a foundation of dominant 7th chords — chords that in classical theory "want" to resolve somewhere else — but blues just stays in that unresolved, gritty sound and makes a home there. That's the emotional core of it.

### What Makes Blues Harmony Distinctive

In standard tonal harmony, only the V chord is a dominant 7th. In blues, *every* chord is a dominant 7th (or at least can be). The I7, IV7, and V7 all stack that same b7 on top, which creates a constant low-level tension that never fully resolves. Add the blues scale with its b3 and b7, and you've got a sound that's simultaneously major and minor — that ambiguity is the whole thing.

### Common Blues Progressions

#### The 12-Bar Blues (Basic)
| Bars | Chords |
|------|--------|
| 1-4  | I7     |
| 5-6  | IV7    |
| 7-8  | I7     |
| 9    | V7     |
| 10   | IV7    |
| 11   | I7     |
| 12   | V7 (turnaround) |

**In A:** A7 - A7 - A7 - A7 - D7 - D7 - A7 - A7 - E7 - D7 - A7 - E7

**In G:** G7 - G7 - G7 - G7 - C7 - C7 - G7 - G7 - D7 - C7 - G7 - D7

#### The Quick-Four 12-Bar Blues
Same as above but the IV7 shows up in bar 2 as well. This is more common in contemporary blues and gives the progression a bit more early momentum.

**In E:** E7 - A7 - E7 - E7 - A7 - A7 - E7 - E7 - B7 - A7 - E7 - B7

#### The Jazz-Blues (Minor Substitutions)
Once blues started mixing with jazz, the harmony got more sophisticated. The turnaround especially starts incorporating ii-V motion.

**Roman numerals:** I7 - IV7 - I7 - I7 - IV7 - IV7 - I7 - VI7 - ii7 - V7 - I7 - VI7 - ii7 - V7

**In Bb:** Bb7 - Eb7 - Bb7 - Bb7 - Eb7 - Eb7 - Bb7 - G7 - Cm7 - F7 - Bb7 - G7 - Cm7 - F7

#### The 8-Bar Blues
**I - I - IV - IV - I - V - IV - I**

**In E:** E7 - E7 - A7 - A7 - E7 - B7 - A7 - E7

Simpler and rawer. Think early country-blues and a lot of folk-influenced blues.

#### Minor Blues
**Im7 - IVm7 - Im7 - Im7 - IVm7 - IVm7 - Im7 - Im7 - bVII - bVI - Im7 - V7**

**In Am:** Am7 - Dm7 - Am7 - Am7 - Dm7 - Dm7 - Am7 - Am7 - G - F - Am7 - E7

That bVII - bVI move in bars 9-10 is the minor blues signature. It's deeply melancholy.

---

## Jazz

Jazz harmony is about motion — specifically, the movement of dominant chords resolving by a fifth. The ii-V-I is the engine that drives basically everything. Once you internalize that, you can start seeing how complex jazz tunes are really just a string of ii-V-Is in different keys, sometimes moving fast, sometimes with substitutions.

### What Makes Jazz Harmony Distinctive

Voice leading is everything in jazz. Chords move so that individual notes resolve smoothly by half-step. Maj7, m7, and dominant 7 chords are the vocabulary, and extensions (9ths, 11ths, 13ths) and alterations (b9, #11, b13) color them. Tritone substitutions replace a dominant 7 chord with the dominant 7 a tritone away — V7 becomes bII7 — and this is enormously common in jazz.

### Common Jazz Progressions

#### The ii-V-I (Major)
The backbone of jazz. Absolutely everywhere.

**Roman numerals:** ii7 - V7 - Imaj7

**In C:** Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7

**In F:** Gm7 - C7 - Fmaj7

**In Bb:** Cm7 - F7 - Bbmaj7

#### The ii-V-I (Minor)
**Roman numerals:** iiø7 - V7b9 - Im(maj7)

**In Am:** Bm7b5 - E7b9 - Am(maj7)

The half-diminished ii chord and the altered dominant with b9 give minor ii-V-Is their characteristic dark, tense sound. The Im(maj7) is unusual — major 7 over a minor root — and it's that little dissonance that makes it so evocative.

#### I Got Rhythm Changes (A Section)
One of the most-used progressions in jazz, from Gershwin's "I Got Rhythm." Practically every jazz musician has played over this at some point.

**Roman numerals:** I - VI7 - ii7 - V7 (repeated) / I - VII7 - IIIm7 - VI7 / ii7 - V7 - I - I

**In Bb:** Bbmaj7 - G7 - Cm7 - F7 / Bbmaj7 - Bdim7 - Cm7 - F7 / Bbmaj7 - G7 - Cm7 - F7 / Fm7 - Bb7 - Ebmaj7 - Ab7 / Bbmaj7 - G7 - Cm7 - F7

#### The Turnaround (I - VI - ii - V)
This is the standard way to end a phrase and loop back to the top.

**Roman numerals:** Imaj7 - VI7 - ii7 - V7

**In C:** Cmaj7 - A7 - Dm7 - G7

Notice the VI is dominant (A7 not Am7). That's the "secondary dominant" doing its thing — A7 temporarily treats Dm7 as a I chord, which intensifies the pull.

#### Tritone Sub Turnaround
Same function, hipper sound. Replace V7 with bII7.

**Roman numerals:** Imaj7 - bVII7 - ii7 - bII7

**In C:** Cmaj7 - Bb7 - Dm7 - Db7

The Db7 resolves down by half-step into C. Incredibly smooth.

## Pop

Pop harmony tends to be simple and cyclical. The same four or five chords repeat throughout a song — verse, chorus, bridge — and that familiarity is a feature, not a bug. The trick in pop is that the melody and production do the heavy lifting emotionally, while the chords provide a reliable, warm harmonic bed.

### What Makes Pop Harmony Distinctive

Pop lives in major keys with diatonic chords and loves the I, V, vi, and IV in various orders. The vi chord (relative minor) adds a touch of emotional depth without going fully dark. Borrowed chords from the parallel minor occasionally show up for a moment of color, but mostly pop stays inside the key.

### Common Pop Progressions

#### The I - V - vi - IV ("The Axis Progression")
Probably the single most common chord progression in Western popular music since the 1990s. Hundreds of hit songs use this exact pattern.

**Roman numerals:** I - V - vi - IV

**In C:** C - G - Am - F

**In G:** G - D - Em - C

**In D:** D - A - Bm - G

You can start this progression on any of the four chords and it still works. Starting on vi gives you the "vi - IV - I - V" version which sounds more melancholic.

#### The I - IV - V - IV
Older and more symmetrical. Common in 60s and early 70s pop and rock.

**Roman numerals:** I - IV - V - IV

**In C:** C - F - G - F

**In A:** A - D - E - D

#### The I - vi - IV - V ("50s Progression")
The doo-wop and early rock and roll standard. Still shows up all the time, just updated with contemporary production.

**Roman numerals:** I - vi - IV - V

**In C:** C - Am - F - G

**In E:** E - C#m - A - B

#### The vi - IV - I - V (Minor-Start Pop)
Same chords as the Axis Progression, just starting on vi. Feels more serious, a little more emotionally complex. A lot of pop ballads use this.

**Roman numerals:** vi - IV - I - V

**In C:** Am - F - C - G

**In A:** F#m - D - A - E

#### The I - bVII - IV - I (Mixolydian)
The bVII chord is borrowed from the parallel Mixolydian mode and gives this progression a slightly anthemic, classic rock-ish quality even in a pop context. Common in arena pop and singer-songwriter material.

**Roman numerals:** I - bVII - IV - I

**In C:** C - Bb - F - C

**In D:** D - C - G - D

---

## Rock

Rock harmony overlaps significantly with pop and blues but has its own character: power, physicality, and a fondness for modal sounds. The Mixolydian bVII chord appears constantly. Pentatonic riffs often imply chords rather than stating them outright. And rock isn't afraid of a good chromatic move.

### What Makes Rock Harmony Distinctive

Rock guitar is usually playing power chords (root and fifth, no third), which means the harmony is often neither definitively major nor minor. The melody or the context decides. This ambiguity, combined with the distortion and rhythmic drive, is what gives rock its particular energy.

### Common Rock Progressions

#### The I - bVII - IV (Mixolydian Rock)
This is the quintessential "rock" progression. The bVII is borrowed from Mixolydian mode and sounds powerful rather than bluesy.

**Roman numerals:** I - bVII - IV

**In A:** A - G - D

**In E:** E - D - A

Repeat endlessly, vary the rhythm, add a guitar riff. That's rock and roll.

#### The I - IV - bVII - IV
A slight extension of the above with more movement.

**In D:** D - G - C - G

**In A:** A - D - G - D

#### The I - V - IV (Classic Rock)
Simple, powerful. The V here often doesn't resolve the way it "should" — it just moves to IV instead, which gives rock its non-classical character.

**Roman numerals:** I - V - IV

**In E:** E - B - A

**In A:** A - E - D

#### The i - bVII - bVI - bVII (Minor Rock)
When rock goes to minor, this is the go-to pattern. Descending and ominous.

**Roman numerals:** i - bVII - bVI - bVII

**In Am:** Am - G - F - G

**In Em:** Em - D - C - D

Think of basically any "dark" rock ballad or metal track.

#### The i - bVI - bIII - bVII
A minor key four-chord loop that's everywhere in hard rock and post-grunge. All four chords come from the natural minor scale.

**Roman numerals:** i - bVI - bIII - bVII

**In Am:** Am - F - C - G

**In Em:** Em - C - G - D

---

## Folk

Folk harmony is honest and unadorned. It tends to stay diatonic, uses simple triads, and relies on the voice and melody to carry emotional weight. The guitar and banjo patterns — fingerpicking, flatpicking arpeggios — are as much about the texture as the chords themselves.

### What Makes Folk Harmony Distinctive

Folk is often modal, particularly Dorian and Mixolydian. Minor tunes frequently use a natural minor (Aeolian) or Dorian feel rather than the harmonic minor scale you'd find in classical music. And folk loves a good suspended chord — the sus2 and sus4 create an open, unresolved quality that suits the lyric content.

### Common Folk Progressions

#### The I - IV - I - V (Simple Folk)
The most fundamental folk progression. Two-beat chords, steady strum or fingerpick.

**Roman numerals:** I - IV - I - V

**In G:** G - C - G - D

**In D:** D - G - D - A

#### The I - V - vi - IV (Folk-Pop)
The pop axis progression shows up in folk too, especially contemporary folk-pop (think singer-songwriter material).

**In G:** G - D - Em - C

**In C:** C - G - Am - F

#### The i - VII - VI - VII (Aeolian Folk)
A natural minor loop. No raised 7th, no leading tone. This creates a flowing, circular quality rather than a directed harmonic motion.

**Roman numerals:** i - VII - VI - VII

**In Am:** Am - G - F - G

**In Em:** Em - D - C - D

#### The Dorian i - IV (Dorian Folk)
The Dorian mode raises the 6th of the natural minor scale, which means the iv chord becomes major. This is common in Celtic and Appalachian music.

**Roman numerals:** i - IV (Dorian)

**In Dm:** Dm - G - Dm - G  (G is major because Dorian gives us B-natural)

**In Am:** Am - D - Am - D  (D is major)

#### The I - ii - IV - V (Campfire)
A slightly more sophisticated folk loop that includes the ii chord. Very common in Americana and folk-rock.

**Roman numerals:** I - ii - IV - V

**In G:** G - Am - C - D

**In D:** D - Em - G - A

## R&B / Soul

R&B and soul harmony is lush. Chords are extended — 7ths, 9ths, sometimes 13ths — and the voice leading between them is smooth. There's a strong gospel influence, meaning the IV chord gets used in expressive, sometimes unexpected ways. Neo-soul (D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill) extended this even further, incorporating jazz harmony into a groove-based context.

### What Makes R&B/Soul Harmony Distinctive

The IV - I movement (called a "plagal cadence" in classical theory, "amen cadence" in gospel) is used emotionally and constantly. Chord substitutions are common. And rhythm is inseparable from harmony — a Dm9 on beat 1 sounds completely different depending on whether it's hit hard with horns or laid back with a Rhodes.

### Common R&B/Soul Progressions

#### The I - IV - I - IV (Gospel Soul)
Back and forth between I and IV. Feels devotional, communal.

**Roman numerals:** I - IV - I - IV

**In C:** Cmaj7 - Fmaj7 - Cmaj7 - Fmaj7

**In G:** Gmaj7 - Cmaj7 - Gmaj7 - Cmaj7

#### The i - bVII - bVI - bVII (Minor Soul)
This is everywhere in classic soul. Smoky, late-night, deeply emotional.

**Roman numerals:** i7 - bVII7 - bVI7 - bVII7

**In Dm:** Dm7 - C7 - Bb7 - C7

**In Am:** Am7 - G7 - F7 - G7

#### The ii - V - I - IV (Soul Cadence)
A jazz-influenced resolution that feels satisfying and warm. The IV at the end acts as a "deceptive" continuation, preventing the I from feeling like a full stop.

**Roman numerals:** ii7 - V7 - Imaj7 - IVmaj7

**In C:** Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7 - Fmaj7

**In F:** Gm7 - C7 - Fmaj7 - Bbmaj7

#### The I - bIII - IV (Gospel Lift)
The bIII is a borrowed chord from the parallel minor. Moving I - bIII - IV creates a lifting, ascending feeling that's particularly common in gospel-influenced R&B choruses.

**Roman numerals:** I - bIII - IV

**In C:** C - Eb - F

**In G:** G - Bb - C

#### The Neo-Soul i - bVII - i - IV
Circular and hypnotic. Neo-soul tends to sit in one place harmonically and let the groove and melody create the interest.

**Roman numerals:** im7 - bVIImaj7 - im7 - IVmaj7 (Dorian IV)

**In Dm:** Dm9 - Cmaj7 - Dm9 - Gmaj7

**In Am:** Am9 - Gmaj7 - Am9 - Dmaj7

## Country

Country harmony is functional and direct. It values clarity — you always know where you are harmonically. The I, IV, and V cover most of the territory, with the vi adding emotional depth in ballads and the occasional borrowed chord for drama. Nashville Number System shorthand (1, 4, 5) reflects how practically the genre thinks about harmony.

### What Makes Country Harmony Distinctive

The perfect authentic cadence (V - I) lands with conviction in country — unlike rock, which often avoids or subverts it. The pedal steel guitar's voice leading influences how chords are voiced. And the genre loves a half-step bass walk between chords that creates implied passing harmonies.

### Common Country Progressions

#### The I - IV - V - I (Nashville Classic)
The foundation of country. Three chords and the truth.

**Roman numerals:** I - IV - V - I

**In G:** G - C - D - G

**In A:** A - D - E - A

**In E:** E - A - B - E

#### The I - V - IV - V (Country Shuffle)
Swaps the order for a slightly more driving feeling. Common in country shuffle tunes.

**Roman numerals:** I - V - IV - V

**In G:** G - D - C - D

#### The I - vi - IV - V (Country Ballad)
Adding the vi chord opens up the emotional register. This is the progression behind countless country weepers.

**Roman numerals:** I - vi - IV - V

**In G:** G - Em - C - D

**In D:** D - Bm - G - A

#### The I - I - IV - I - V - IV - I - V (Country 8-Bar)
An 8-bar version of the basic country form, common in traditional and honky-tonk styles.

**In C:** C - C - F - C - G - F - C - G

#### The I - IV - I - V - I (Three-Chord Country Loop)
**In A:** A - D - A - E - A

This one never goes to the vi or borrows from anywhere. Just the three primary chords, cycling through. Earthy and unpretentious.

## Bossa Nova

Bossa Nova, which emerged from Brazil in the late 1950s (particularly through João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim), is a fusion of samba rhythm with the harmonic language of cool jazz. The harmony is sophisticated — lots of maj7, maj9, and altered dominant chords — but it feels light and airy rather than dense, thanks to the gentle samba-influenced rhythmic feel.

### What Makes Bossa Nova Harmony Distinctive

Bossa Nova uses jazz chord vocabulary but treats it with a Brazilian sensibility. Chords are often voiced with the melody note on top, and the inner voices move chromatically. Jobim's songs in particular are full of ii-V-Is (often with tritone subs) and sudden key changes that feel logical in the moment. The Imaj7#11 (Lydian-flavored tonic) and the II7 (Lydian dominant) are characteristic colors.

### Common Bossa Nova Progressions

#### The ii-V-I with Extensions (Bossa Standard)
Just like jazz, but the chords are voiced more openly and the rhythm is the clave-influenced bossa pattern.

**Roman numerals:** ii9 - V13 - Imaj9

**In C:** Dm9 - G13 - Cmaj9

**In F:** Gm9 - C13 - Fmaj9

#### The Imaj7 - II7 - Imaj7 (Lydian Flavor)
The II7 (major II dominant 7th, not the diatonic ii minor 7) creates a brief Lydian color — it's the same as a tritone sub of the V. Very characteristic of Jobim.

**Roman numerals:** Imaj7 - II7 - Imaj7

**In C:** Cmaj7 - D7 - Cmaj7

**In G:** Gmaj7 - A7 - Gmaj7

#### The Corcovado-Style Progression
Jobim's "Corcovado" (Quiet Nights) exemplifies a descending bass line with changing upper harmony — a very characteristic bossa texture.

**Roman numerals:** Imaj7 - I7/bVII - IVmaj7 - iv7 - IIImaj7 - bIII°7 - ii7 - V7

**In C:** Cmaj7 - C7/Bb - Fmaj7 - Fm7 - Em7 - Eb°7 - Dm7 - G7

The chromatic descent in the bass (C - Bb - ... - Eb - ...) is a hallmark of bossa nova writing.

#### The "Girl from Ipanema" Loop
This isn't a single progression so much as a harmonic gesture: a Fmaj7 chord that suddenly jumps to Gb7 (a tritone away from C, the implied V of F), creating a gorgeous, floating sense of momentary harmonic weightlessness before resolving.

**Roman numerals in F:** Fmaj7 (4 bars) - Gb7 (2 bars) - B7 (2 bars) - Bbmaj7 (2 bars) - Bbm7 - Eb7 - Am7 - D7 - Gm7 - C7 - Fmaj7

This is the actual harmonic rhythm of the bridge of "Girl from Ipanema" and it's worth studying carefully for anyone wanting to understand Jobim's approach.

#### The Simple Bossa ii-V-I Turnaround with Tritone Sub
**Roman numerals:** ii7 - bII7 - Imaj7

**In C:** Dm7 - Db7 - Cmaj7

The Db7 substitutes for G7 and slides down by half-step into C. Utterly smooth. This substitution is used in bossa constantly, often without even pausing on the ii chord.

## Quick Reference: Progressions by Mood

If you're trying to match a harmonic approach to an emotional target, here's a rough map:

| Mood | Genre Direction | Key Progression |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Tense, unresolved | Blues | I7 - IV7 - V7 |
| Sophisticated, moving | Jazz | ii7 - V7 - Imaj7 |
| Warm, familiar | Pop | I - V - vi - IV |
| Powerful, driving | Rock | I - bVII - IV |
| Open, honest | Folk | I - IV - I - V |
| Lush, devotional | R&B/Soul | I - IV - I - IV (extended chords) |
| Direct, emotional | Country | I - vi - IV - V |
| Airy, sophisticated | Bossa Nova | ii9 - V13 - Imaj9 |

## A Note on Using Roman Numerals

Throughout this document, roman numerals are used in their standard form:
- Uppercase (I, IV, V) = major chord
- Lowercase (i, iv, v) = minor chord
- The chord quality (7, maj7, m7, etc.) is added as a suffix
- The prefix (b or #) indicates a chromatic alteration of the root

When a progression is given in a specific key (e.g., "In C: C - Am - F - G"), the chord symbols are music21-compatible: Dm7, Cmaj7, G7, F#m, Bb, Ebmaj9, etc.

The most valuable thing you can do with any of these progressions is transpose them to all twelve keys at the keyboard or on your instrument. You'll start hearing the *function* rather than the letter names, which is when theory actually becomes useful at a gig.
