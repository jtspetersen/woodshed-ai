# Scales and Modes: A Comprehensive Reference Guide

Understanding scales and modes is one of the most practical things you can do as a musician. Rather than memorizing shapes and patterns in isolation, this guide explains the *why* behind each scale — what makes it sound the way it does, where it lives in music, and how to use it. Whether you're a guitarist working out solos, a pianist exploring jazz harmony, or a composer looking for the right color, this reference has you covered.

## The Diatonic Modes

The seven diatonic modes all come from the same source material: the major scale. Each mode starts on a different degree of the major scale and treats that note as "home." The result is seven distinct flavors built from the same seven notes. The key is understanding *which note is the characteristic note* — the one that bends your ear in a specific direction.

### Ionian (Major Scale)

**Interval Formula:** W-W-H-W-W-W-H

**Degree Formula:** 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 5 – 6 – 7

**Characteristic Notes:** The natural 3rd and natural 7th. The major 3rd declares "this is major," and the major 7th creates a bright, slightly yearning quality.

**Sound and Mood:** Bright, stable, resolved, happy. This is the default "do-re-mi" sound that Western ears are most conditioned to hear as neutral and consonant.

**Common Uses:** Pop, folk, country, classical melody, children's music. Used over major chords (Imaj7) and in any context where you want an open, unambiguous major sound.

**Example in C Major:** C – D – E – F – G – A – B – C

The C major scale is the starting point for everything. Every white key on a piano, played in order from C to C, gives you Ionian.

---

### Dorian

**Interval Formula:** W-H-W-W-W-H-W

**Degree Formula:** 1 – 2 – b3 – 4 – 5 – 6 – b7

**Characteristic Note:** The natural 6th. Dorian is minor (flat 3rd, flat 7th) but the raised 6th keeps it from sounding dark or heavy. That single note lifts the scale out of pure minor territory.

**Sound and Mood:** Minor but cool, sophisticated, and slightly funky. It has a kind of darkness that still breathes freely. Often described as "hip" or "sophisticated" in jazz contexts.

**Common Uses:** Jazz (ii-7 chords in a major key), funk, R&B, rock. Carlos Santana built a career on Dorian. Miles Davis's *So What* is the textbook Dorian example. Works beautifully over minor 7th chords (m7).

**Example in D Dorian:** D – E – F – G – A – B – C – D

Notice these are the same notes as C major — just starting from D. The B natural is the characteristic raised 6th.

---

### Phrygian

**Interval Formula:** H-W-W-W-H-W-W

**Degree Formula:** 1 – b2 – b3 – 4 – 5 – b6 – b7

**Characteristic Note:** The flat 2nd (minor second above the root). This note, sometimes called the Phrygian second, is what gives the mode its dark, Spanish, and slightly menacing flavor. Moving from the root up to the b2 is instantly recognizable.

**Sound and Mood:** Dark, tense, Spanish, exotic, flamenco. The flat 2 creates immediate harmonic friction and pulls the ear toward something tense or mysterious.

**Common Uses:** Flamenco music, metal (where it appears constantly for its dark aggression), Spanish classical guitar. In jazz, used over the III chord in a major key or over suspended b9 chords. Also the basis for the Phrygian Dominant mode.

**Example in E Phrygian:** E – F – G – A – B – C – D – E

These are the same notes as C major starting from E. The F natural (just a half step above E) is the signature Phrygian sound.

---

### Lydian

**Interval Formula:** W-W-W-H-W-W-H

**Degree Formula:** 1 – 2 – 3 – #4 – 5 – 6 – 7

**Characteristic Note:** The raised 4th (sharp 4 or #4, also called an augmented fourth or tritone above the root). This is the only note that separates Lydian from Ionian, and it makes all the difference. Where Ionian is grounded, Lydian floats.

**Sound and Mood:** Dreamy, ethereal, otherworldly, floating. Lydian is major but with an unsettled shimmer. Film composers love it for scenes involving wonder, magic, space, or fantasy. Think of the opening notes of "The Simpsons" theme or virtually any John Williams cue involving wonder.

**Common Uses:** Film scoring, jazz (Imaj7#11 chords), progressive rock, any context where you want major with a dreamy or slightly unresolved quality. The Lydian mode is the natural mode to use over a major 7 #11 chord.

**Example in F Lydian:** F – G – A – B – C – D – E – F

The B natural (instead of the expected Bb in an F major context) is the #4 that gives Lydian its lift.

---

### Mixolydian

**Interval Formula:** W-W-H-W-W-H-W

**Degree Formula:** 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 5 – 6 – b7

**Characteristic Note:** The flat 7th. Mixolydian is major (natural 3rd) but with a flatted 7th, which removes the leading tone pull back to the root. This creates a more relaxed, unresolved, open quality compared to Ionian.

**Sound and Mood:** Bluesy, rock, folk, open. The b7 gives Mixolydian its characteristic "settled but unresolved" quality. It sounds major without sounding formal or classical. It's one of the most used modes in rock and blues.

**Common Uses:** Rock (classic rock, blues-rock), funk, country, Celtic music. Used over dominant 7th chords (7 chords) — whenever you see a G7, G Mixolydian fits perfectly. The chord built on the V of a major key is naturally Mixolydian.

**Example in G Mixolydian:** G – A – B – C – D – E – F – G

Same notes as C major starting from G. The F natural (instead of F#) makes this distinct from G major and gives it that bluesy openness.

---

### Aeolian (Natural Minor Scale)

**Interval Formula:** W-H-W-W-H-W-W

**Degree Formula:** 1 – 2 – b3 – 4 – 5 – b6 – b7

**Characteristic Notes:** The flat 3rd, flat 6th, and flat 7th together create a particular melancholic darkness. The flat 6th in particular is what distinguishes Aeolian from Dorian (which has a natural 6).

**Sound and Mood:** Sad, serious, melancholic, heavy. This is the "default minor" that most people imagine when they think of minor keys. It has a gravity and weight that makes it the go-to for ballads, minor key pop, and dramatic passages.

**Common Uses:** Pop ballads, rock, metal, classical music (as the natural minor scale), film scoring for sad or tense scenes. Used over minor chords, especially i, iv, and bVII chord progressions (very common in rock: Am – G – F – C or similar).

**Example in A Aeolian:** A – B – C – D – E – F – G – A

Same notes as C major starting from A. A minor is the relative minor of C major.

---

### Locrian

**Interval Formula:** H-W-W-H-W-W-W

**Degree Formula:** 1 – b2 – b3 – 4 – b5 – b6 – b7

**Characteristic Notes:** The flat 2nd and flat 5th. The diminished fifth above the root means there is no perfect fifth in this scale — the most unstable interval defines the tonic triad, making it a diminished chord rather than a minor or major chord. Locrian has no stable center.

**Sound and Mood:** Extremely dark, unstable, dissonant, unresolved. Locrian is rarely used as a primary tonal center precisely because it offers no stable landing place. It sounds like tension without resolution.

**Common Uses:** Metal, avant-garde, jazz (over half-diminished or m7b5 chords — the VII chord in a major key). In jazz, B Locrian is used over a Bm7b5 chord, which commonly appears as the ii of a minor ii-V-i. Locrian is more of a tool for specific chord colors than a tonal center.

**Example in B Locrian:** B – C – D – E – F – G – A – B

Same notes as C major starting from B. The F natural creates the b5 above B, giving Locrian its defining instability.

---

## Pentatonic Scales

Pentatonic scales contain five notes (penta = five) and are found in virtually every musical culture on earth. Their widespread appeal comes from their natural consonance — by removing the most dissonant intervals from the major or minor scale, you're left with a collection of notes that fits easily over a broad range of chords.

### Major Pentatonic

**Interval Formula:** W-W-W+H-W-W+H (where W+H = minor third = three half steps)

**Degree Formula:** 1 – 2 – 3 – 5 – 6

**Characteristic Notes:** The absence of the 4th and 7th removes the two notes most likely to clash with major chord tones. What remains is pure consonance.

**Sound and Mood:** Bright, open, happy, folky, simple. Major pentatonic has a timeless, universal quality. It works over major chords without any danger of landing on a "wrong" note.

**Common Uses:** Country, folk, pop, gospel, blues (major pentatonic gives the "happy blues" sound), bluegrass. Classic country and rock solos often live almost entirely in the major pentatonic. Think of the melody to "My Girl" or most of George Strait's leads.

**Example in G Major Pentatonic:** G – A – B – D – E – G

---

### Minor Pentatonic

**Interval Formula:** W+H-W-W-W+H-W

**Degree Formula:** 1 – b3 – 4 – 5 – b7

**Characteristic Notes:** The flat 3rd and flat 7th establish a minor feeling, while the absence of the 2nd and 6th keeps things simple and powerful.

**Sound and Mood:** Bluesy, raw, powerful, gritty. Minor pentatonic is probably the most commonly used scale in rock guitar. Its simplicity is a strength — every note is strong and expressive.

**Common Uses:** Blues, rock, metal, R&B. The foundation of most rock guitar soloing. Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, and countless others built their vocabulary primarily from the minor pentatonic.

**Example in A Minor Pentatonic:** A – C – D – E – G – A

This scale is so common in rock guitar that its five box positions are often the first patterns a guitarist learns.

---

## Blues Scale

**Interval Formula:** W+H-W-H-H-W+H-W

**Degree Formula:** 1 – b3 – 4 – b5 – 5 – b7

**Characteristic Note:** The b5, often called the "blue note." The blues scale is the minor pentatonic with one added note: the flatted fifth. This single addition adds tension, expressiveness, and that unmistakable blues feeling. Bending into and out of this note is a core blues technique.

**Sound and Mood:** Gritty, expressive, emotionally raw. The blues scale is the sound of tension and release. It doesn't resolve so much as it sighs.

**Common Uses:** Blues (obviously), rock, jazz blues, R&B, soul. Virtually any blues or rock context. The b5 is often used as a passing tone — you bend through it on the way to the 5 or resolve it down to the 4.

**Example in A Blues Scale:** A – C – D – Eb – E – G – A

The Eb (the b5) sits between D and E, creating that characteristic bluesy friction. In practice, guitarists often bend from the D up toward this Eb and beyond.

---

## Whole Tone Scale

**Interval Formula:** W-W-W-W-W-W

**Degree Formula:** 1 – 2 – 3 – #4 – #5 – b7

**Characteristic Notes:** Every interval is a whole step — there are no half steps anywhere. This means the scale has no leading tone, no sense of gravity, and no clear direction. There are only two distinct whole tone scales (all others are rotations of these two).

**Sound and Mood:** Floating, dreamy, ambiguous, surreal. Without any half-step pull, whole tone scales have no gravitational center. They shimmer and drift. Claude Debussy used them extensively to evoke water, mist, and dreamlike states.

**Common Uses:** Jazz (over augmented chords or dominant 7#5 chords), impressionist classical music, film scoring for dreamlike or disorienting moments. The whole tone scale fits perfectly over a 7+5 (dominant seventh sharp five, also written 7#5 or aug7) chord.

**Example in C Whole Tone:** C – D – E – F# – G# – Bb – C

Every step is a whole step. The scale sounds neither major nor minor — it exists in its own ambiguous tonal space.

---

## Diminished Scales

Diminished scales are eight-note (octatonic) scales that alternate between two interval sizes. Because they alternate perfectly, they have a high degree of symmetry — they repeat every minor third (three half steps). This symmetry is part of their usefulness in jazz: one fingering pattern works over multiple roots.

### Whole-Half Diminished

**Interval Formula:** W-H-W-H-W-H-W-H

**Degree Formula:** 1 – 2 – b3 – 4 – b5 – b6 – 6 – 7

**Characteristic Notes:** The combination of b3, b5, b6, and natural 7 creates an unresolved, mysterious tension. The natural 7 (leading tone) alongside the b5 gives it a dissonant, unresolved quality.

**Sound and Mood:** Mysterious, tense, unstable, complex. Often described as "dark but colorful." The symmetry means it has a slightly mechanical or mathematical feeling if overused, but it creates tremendous color in the right context.

**Common Uses:** Jazz over diminished 7th chords (dim7, also written °7). A C whole-half diminished works over Cdim7, Ebdim7, Gbdim7, and Adim7 (all the same chord, enharmonically). Also used in classical music for tense passages.

**Example in C Whole-Half:** C – D – Eb – F – Gb – Ab – A – B – C

---

### Half-Whole Diminished

**Interval Formula:** H-W-H-W-H-W-H-W

**Degree Formula:** 1 – b2 – b3 – 3 – #4 – 5 – 6 – b7

**Characteristic Notes:** The b9 (flat 2nd), #11, and b13 (flat 6th) make this scale rich in alterations. It contains both the major 3rd and minor 3rd, both the natural 5th and the flat 5th (#4).

**Sound and Mood:** Tense, dissonant, bebop-ready. The half-whole diminished is one of the most practical scales in jazz because it sounds great over dominant chords and creates maximum harmonic tension before resolution.

**Common Uses:** Jazz, bebop, fusion — primarily over dominant 7th chords (V7 chords) when you want an altered, tense sound. The G half-whole diminished is a favorite over a G7 chord resolving to C. Also called the "dominant diminished" scale for this reason.

**Example in G Half-Whole:** G – Ab – Bb – B – C# – D – E – F – G

Over a G7 chord, those extra tensions (Ab = b9, B = major 3, C# = #11) create a rich, dissonant color that resolves beautifully to C major.

---

## Altered Scale (Super Locrian)

**Interval Formula:** H-W-H-W-W-W-W

**Degree Formula:** 1 – b2 – b3 – b4(= 3) – b5 – b6 – b7

*Spelled as alterations: 1 – b9 – #9 – 3 – b5 (#11) – b13 – b7*

**Characteristic Notes:** Every note that can be altered on a dominant chord IS altered: b9, #9, b5 (#11), b13. The only "stable" tones are the root, major 3rd, and minor 7th — the essential tones of a dominant 7th chord. Everything else is tension.

**Sound and Mood:** Maximum tension, chromatic, sophisticated, "outside." The altered scale is the tension machine of jazz. When you want to create the most possible tension before resolving to a chord, this scale does the job.

**Common Uses:** Jazz, fusion, bebop — exclusively over dominant 7th chords (V7alt) that are about to resolve. The C altered scale is used over C7alt before resolving to Fmaj7. This is the seventh mode of the melodic minor scale — C altered uses the same notes as Db melodic minor.

**Example in C Altered (= Db Melodic Minor starting from C):** C – Db – Eb – E – Gb – Ab – Bb – C

The relationship to Db melodic minor is one of the key insights of jazz theory: to play altered on any dominant chord, simply play the melodic minor scale starting a half step up.

---

## Harmonic Minor

**Interval Formula:** W-H-W-W-H-W+H-H

**Degree Formula:** 1 – 2 – b3 – 4 – 5 – b6 – 7

**Characteristic Notes:** The natural 7th (leading tone) in an otherwise minor scale, and the augmented second (W+H = three half steps) between the b6 and the natural 7. This gap of a minor third within the scale is what gives harmonic minor its unmistakable exotic, almost Middle-Eastern quality.

**Sound and Mood:** Dark but with tension toward resolution. Classical, Spanish, Middle-Eastern, dramatic. The raised 7th creates a strong leading-tone pull back to the root, which was essential for functional harmony in classical music — hence the name "harmonic" minor. In a minor key, raising the 7th creates a dominant V7 chord (instead of a minor v chord), giving the progression more harmonic drive.

**Common Uses:** Classical music (especially Baroque and Classical era minor-key works), flamenco, metal (particularly neoclassical metal à la Yngwie Malmsteen and Ritchie Blackmore), Middle-Eastern influenced music. Used over the V7 chord in a minor key, and over diminished chords.

**Example in A Harmonic Minor:** A – B – C – D – E – F – G# – A

Compare this to A natural minor (A – B – C – D – E – F – G – A) — the only difference is the G# (raised 7th). That half step at the top of the scale makes an enormous difference in character and harmonic function.

---

## Melodic Minor

**Interval Formula (ascending):** W-H-W-W-W-W-H

**Degree Formula:** 1 – 2 – b3 – 4 – 5 – 6 – 7

**Characteristic Notes:** Like harmonic minor, it has a raised 7th, but it also raises the 6th compared to natural minor. In classical use, the scale descends as natural minor (to avoid the augmented second and smooth out the melodic line going down), but in jazz, the ascending form is used in both directions.

**Sound and Mood:** Minor with brightness. Sophisticated, slightly ambiguous. Melodic minor has the warmth of minor (the b3) combined with the brightness of major (natural 6 and 7). Jazz musicians love it precisely because of this duality.

**Common Uses:** Classical (ascending form for smooth vocal lines), jazz (where it generates a powerful set of modes). The modes of melodic minor are essential jazz sounds: the 4th mode is Lydian Dominant (used everywhere in jazz), the 6th mode is the Locrian #2 (used over m7b5 chords), and the 7th mode is the Altered scale described above.

**Example in A Melodic Minor:** A – B – C – D – E – F# – G# – A

The F# and G# (raised 6th and 7th) brighten the sound compared to natural or harmonic minor, while the C keeps the minor feeling alive.

## Bebop Scales

Bebop scales are a family of scales developed by jazz musicians in the bebop era (1940s) to solve a specific rhythmic problem: how do you play a scale and consistently land chord tones on the downbeats? By adding a chromatic passing tone to standard scales (bringing them to 8 notes), you can run through a scale in eighth notes and have the chord tones naturally fall on beats 1, 2, 3, and 4.

### Dominant Bebop Scale

**Interval Formula:** W-W-H-W-W-H-H-H (adding a passing tone between b7 and root)

**Degree Formula:** 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 5 – 6 – b7 – 7 – (8/1)

**Characteristic Notes:** The chromatic passing tone between the b7 and the natural 7 (or the root). This creates an 8-note scale that lets you run eighth-note lines with chord tones on the beats.

**Sound and Mood:** Swinging, bebop, classic jazz. The extra note isn't really a "musical" choice so much as a rhythmic one — it's a mechanical device for making lines work rhythmically.

**Common Uses:** Jazz, bebop — over dominant 7th chords. This is the standard bebop vocabulary for V7 chords. Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and virtually all bebop musicians used these scale patterns constantly.

**Example in G Dominant Bebop:** G – A – B – C – D – E – F – F# – G

The F# is the added passing tone between the b7 (F) and the root (G). Starting on a chord tone on beat 1, every other note lands on a chord tone.

---

### Major Bebop Scale

**Interval Formula:** W-W-H-W-H-H-W-H

**Degree Formula:** 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 5 – #5 – 6 – 7

**Characteristic Notes:** The chromatic passing tone between the 5th and 6th degrees. This addition to the major scale creates the 8-note bebop version.

**Sound and Mood:** Bright, swinging, classic jazz. Like the dominant bebop scale, the major bebop scale is primarily a device for rhythmic alignment over major chords.

**Common Uses:** Jazz — over major 7 chords and major chords (I chords). Starting on the root on beat 1, chord tones (root, 3rd, 5th, 7th) fall on the downbeats.

**Example in C Major Bebop:** C – D – E – F – G – G# – A – B – C

The G# is the chromatic passing tone between G (5th) and A (6th). In actual jazz playing, this note is used in passing — you move through it, not to it.

---

### Minor Bebop Scale (Dorian Bebop)

**Interval Formula:** W-H-W-W-W-H-H-H

**Degree Formula:** 1 – 2 – b3 – 4 – 5 – 6 – b7 – 7 – (8/1)

**Characteristic Notes:** Based on the Dorian mode with a chromatic passing tone between the b7 and the natural 7 (same location as the dominant bebop scale). This allows smooth running lines over minor chords.

**Sound and Mood:** Swinging minor, sophisticated, bebop. The minor bebop scale is the go-to for swinging over ii-7 chords in jazz.

**Common Uses:** Jazz — primarily over minor 7th chords (ii-7 chords). Starting on the root on the downbeat, the scale's structure ensures that chord tones (root, b3, 5, b7) fall on the strong beats of the bar.

**Example in D Minor Bebop:** D – E – F – G – A – B – C – C# – D

The C# is the chromatic passing tone. The underlying scale is D Dorian (D – E – F – G – A – B – C) with the added chromatic note before the octave.

---

## Putting It All Together

### The Big Picture

The scales in this guide break into a few conceptual families:

**Major-derived modes** (Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian) share the same note collection, just approached from different starting points. Understanding that Dorian is just a major scale starting from the second degree demystifies a lot of theory.

**Minor variants** (Harmonic minor, Melodic minor) modify the natural minor scale to serve specific harmonic or melodic purposes. Harmonic minor raises the 7th for harmonic function; melodic minor raises both the 6th and 7th for smooth melodic motion.

**Symmetrical scales** (Whole tone, Diminished) have internal mathematical regularity that removes the usual sense of gravity and direction. Their ambiguity is their strength in the right context.

**The blues scales** (Minor pentatonic, Blues scale) are about feel and expression more than theoretical precision. These scales are played, not analyzed — the blue note especially is more of a region to explore than a fixed pitch.

**Bebop scales** are rhythmic devices as much as tonal ones. The added chromatic note is there to make eighth-note lines work, not to add color.

### Choosing the Right Scale

A practical approach: start with the chord and work outward. Over a major chord, try major pentatonic or Ionian. Over a minor chord, try minor pentatonic, Dorian, or Aeolian. Over a dominant chord, try Mixolydian, the blues scale, or — for jazz — the half-whole diminished or altered scale. Over a diminished chord, try the whole-half diminished.

The ear is always the final judge. Knowing the theory gives you a map, but the music itself tells you where to go.
