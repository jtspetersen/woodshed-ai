## Melancholy / Sad

The sound of sadness in Western music is one of the most well-studied emotional territories in composition. It tends to center on minor tonality, slower movement, and harmonic choices that create a sense of longing or incompleteness.

### Scales and Modes
- **Natural minor (Aeolian)** is the default. Its flat 3rd, 6th, and 7th give a consistently dark, inward quality.
- **Dorian mode** adds a natural 6th to the minor scale, which softens the sadness slightly — useful for bittersweet or introspective melancholy rather than deep grief.
- **Phrygian mode** with its flat 2nd creates a more desolate, world-weary sadness, often used in flamenco and cinematic scoring.
- **Minor pentatonic** strips the harmony down to its emotional essentials and works well for blues-inflected sadness.

### Chord Qualities and Progressions
- Minor triads and minor 7th chords anchor the harmonic palette.
- The **i – VI – III – VII** progression (e.g., Am – F – C – G) is a reliable vehicle for melancholy with a slight sense of movement.
- **i – iv** (minor tonic to minor subdominant) deepens the sadness by avoiding any brightness.
- **i – VII – VI – VII** creates a cyclical, unresolved quality — grief that doesn't move forward.
- Avoid dominant 7th chords resolving strongly to the tonic; the sense of resolution can undercut sadness. Use **minor v** or deceptive cadences instead to keep tension unresolved.
- **Add9 and sus2 chords** in minor can add a fragile, open quality.

### Tempo
- 40–70 BPM. Slower tempos allow phrases to breathe and give the listener time to sit with each harmonic moment.
- Rubato (flexible time) is common in solo piano or vocal ballad contexts — small tempo fluctuations increase emotional authenticity.

### Key Choices
- **D minor, B minor, E minor** are traditional "dark" keys with a muted, introspective quality.
- **C minor and F minor** carry a particularly heavy emotional weight in classical tradition (Beethoven, Chopin both favored these for grief).
- Lower registrations in any key will deepen the sadness — write or transpose down when possible.

### Rhythm Patterns
- Sustained notes and long durations. Minimize syncopation — it injects energy that works against sadness.
- Arpeggiated accompaniment (broken chords) creates a gentle, sighing quality.
- Simple 3/4 or 6/8 can evoke a waltz-like lamentation.

### Harmonic Rhythm
- Slow harmonic rhythm — one chord per bar or two bars per chord. Let each chord resonate fully before moving.
- Occasional pauses between chords (harmonic space) can intensify the emotional weight.

## Bright / Happy / Uplifting

Bright, happy music communicates openness, energy, and optimism. The theory choices here prioritize consonance, forward motion, and tonal clarity.

### Scales and Modes
- **Major scale (Ionian)** is the foundation of bright, happy music in nearly every Western genre.
- **Mixolydian mode** (major scale with a flat 7th) adds a slightly looser, laid-back quality — happy but not saccharine. Common in pop and rock.
- **Major pentatonic** distills happiness into five notes; its absence of half-steps means almost any combination sounds consonant and clear.
- **Lydian mode** (major with a raised 4th) creates an ethereal, almost magical brightness — think John Williams film scores and uplifting cinematic moments.

### Chord Qualities and Progressions
- Major triads and major 7th chords.
- **I – V – vi – IV** (e.g., C – G – Am – F) is ubiquitous in pop for good reason — it's warm, balanced, and uplifting.
- **I – IV – V – I** is the classic resolution that feels complete and joyful.
- **Add9 chords** (major add9) brighten things further without added complexity.
- **sus2 and sus4** chords create a sense of anticipation and openness.
- Avoid minor chords except as passing color — the vi chord is fine, but staying primarily in major chord territory keeps the mood bright.

### Tempo
- 100–140 BPM covers a wide range from cheerful to energetically joyful.
- 120 BPM is a sweet spot for dance-pop happiness.
- Faster tempos (140+) push into excited or euphoric territory.

### Key Choices
- **C major, G major, D major** are traditionally bright, open-sounding keys.
- **E major and A major** have a particularly sparkling quality on guitar and piano.
- Higher register playing adds sparkle — melody in the upper octaves reads as bright and clear.

### Rhythm Patterns
- Syncopation adds bounce and energy. Upbeats and anticipations keep things lively.
- Short, punchy note durations. Staccato playing emphasizes brightness.
- 4/4 with a strong backbeat (pop), or a light shuffle/swing for a more relaxed happy feel.

### Harmonic Rhythm
- Moderate harmonic rhythm — one to two chords per bar keeps things moving without rushing.
- Regular, predictable chord changes reinforce the sense of stability and positivity.

---

## Dark / Ominous / Tense

Darkness in music comes from instability, dissonance, low register, and harmonic uncertainty. The listener should feel like something is wrong or threatening.

### Scales and Modes
- **Phrygian mode** with its distinctive flat 2nd (minor second above the root) is the quintessential ominous scale. The half-step tension at the very bottom of the scale is deeply unsettling.
- **Locrian mode** is the most unstable of all modes — its diminished tonic chord makes true resolution nearly impossible. Use sparingly for extreme tension.
- **Diminished scale (half-whole or whole-half)** creates relentless tension through its symmetrical, ambiguous structure.
- **Chromatic lines** over a static bass note produce a creeping, threatening quality.
- **Harmonic minor** with its augmented 2nd interval creates an exotic, menacing sound.

### Chord Qualities and Progressions
- **Diminished 7th chords** — symmetrical, unresolved, and deeply unsettling.
- **Augmented chords** create an ambiguous, threatening sound that doesn't naturally resolve.
- **Tritone substitutions and tritone-based intervals** in the melody against the bass.
- **Cluster chords** (adjacent half-steps played together) for extreme tension.
- **i – bII** (the Phrygian cadence, e.g., Am – Bb) is a classic ominous move.
- Static harmony or **pedal tones** (a single held bass note while upper voices move) with dissonant upper structures.

### Tempo
- Variable. Slow tempos (40–60 BPM) create dread and anticipation; faster tempos (120–160 BPM) drive panic and action-oriented tension.
- **Irregular or shifting tempos** and sudden stops increase psychological unease.

### Key Choices
- **C# minor, F# minor, Eb minor** — darker, less "resolved"-sounding key signatures.
- **No key center** — atonal writing or constantly shifting tonal centers prevent any sense of safety or arrival.
- Low register is essential. Bass-heavy voicings, low strings, deep piano notes.

### Rhythm Patterns
- Irregular rhythms, odd time signatures (7/8, 5/4), and unexpected accents disrupt the listener's comfort.
- **Staccato low notes** and **silence** used strategically create a sense of lurking danger.
- Ostinato patterns (repeated rhythmic figures) with slight variations build obsessive tension.

### Harmonic Rhythm
- Unpredictable — very slow movement punctuated by sudden shifts. Or very fast, disorienting chord changes that prevent any sense of grounding.

## Dreamy / Ethereal / Floating

Dreamy music creates a sense of suspension, weightlessness, and distance from the everyday world. The goal is harmonic ambiguity and sonic spaciousness.

### Scales and Modes
- **Lydian mode** is the most ethereal mode — the raised 4th creates an unresolved, floating quality that never quite lands.
- **Whole tone scale** has no half-steps and no clear tonal center, creating a drifting, impressionistic sound (think Debussy).
- **Lydian dominant** (Lydian with a flat 7th) for a more modern, cinematic floating feel.
- **Pentatonic scales** with wide spacing and high register voicings.

### Chord Qualities and Progressions
- **Major 7th chords** — the 7th adds a soft, unresolved shimmer above the major triad.
- **Add9, add11, and add13 chords** — lush extensions that blur harmonic clarity.
- **Suspended chords** (sus2, sus4) that don't resolve, left hanging in the air.
- **Non-functional progressions** — chords chosen for color rather than harmonic movement. Parallel major 7th chords a step apart (e.g., Cmaj7 – Dmaj7) create a hovering, drifting quality.
- Avoid strong dominant-to-tonic cadences; resolution breaks the spell.

### Tempo
- 60–90 BPM. Slow enough to feel unhurried, but not so slow as to feel heavy.
- Rubato and flexible time support the free-floating quality.

### Key Choices
- **E major, A major, B major** — open, resonant keys that work well with extended harmonies.
- High register across the board. Treble-heavy textures, sparse bass.

### Rhythm Patterns
- Long sustained notes, gentle swells. Avoid sharp attacks.
- **Cross-rhythms and polyrhythm** (e.g., 3 against 4) create rhythmic ambiguity that floats the listener.
- Light, irregular subdivision — 16th note arpeggios that blur into one another.
- Reverb-heavy production that makes attack points indistinct.

### Harmonic Rhythm
- Very slow — one chord per two to four bars. Or completely static (one chord throughout a section). Harmonic stillness is key to floating.

---

## Aggressive / Intense / Angry

Aggression in music is communicated through volume, distortion, rhythmic drive, and harmonic tension held without release.

### Scales and Modes
- **Phrygian dominant** (5th mode of harmonic minor) has an aggressive, confrontational quality — used extensively in metal and intense film scores.
- **Natural minor and harmonic minor** — especially in fast, driving contexts.
- **Blues scale** with its flat 5th (tritone) adds edge and raw aggression.
- **Chromatic passing tones** used aggressively rather than ornamentally.

### Chord Qualities and Progressions
- **Power chords** (root and 5th only, no 3rd) — ambiguous tonality, pure forward momentum.
- **Minor chords with flat 2nd** — the Phrygian flavor pushes into confrontational territory.
- Rapid **tritone movements** — the most harmonically combative interval.
- **i – bII – i** as a repeated, aggressive riff-based pattern.
- **Chromatic descending bass lines** under static or power chord harmonies.
- Avoid resolution — unresolved tension sustains aggression.

### Tempo
- 140–200+ BPM. Speed is a primary vehicle for intensity and aggression.
- Aggressive music rarely slows down — tempo drops can signal a break in aggression, or a gathering of energy before a more intense burst.

### Key Choices
- **E minor, B minor, D minor** — common in guitar-based aggressive music due to open string resonance on standard tuning.
- **Drop tunings** (drop D, drop C) deepen the aggression through lower register.
- Any key can be aggressive given the right approach, but lower registers and darker keys reinforce the emotion.

### Rhythm Patterns
- **Driving 8th or 16th note patterns**, consistent and relentless.
- Heavy downbeat emphasis — a physical, pounding quality.
- Syncopation used not for bounce but for rhythmic disruption and forward thrust.
- **Odd time signatures** (5/4, 7/8) create rhythmic instability that reads as tension and aggression.

### Harmonic Rhythm
- Fast and unrelenting, OR completely static (one riff or chord held as an aggressive vamp).
- Minimal harmonic movement keeps energy focused on rhythm and timbre rather than harmonic interest.

## Mysterious / Suspenseful

Mystery and suspense sit between tension and resolution — the listener knows something is coming but doesn't know what. Harmonic ambiguity and withheld information are the primary tools.

### Scales and Modes
- **Dorian mode** has a slightly ambiguous quality — minor but with a raised 6th that softens it, creating intrigue rather than full darkness.
- **Phrygian mode** for deeper mystery with a menacing edge.
- **Whole tone scale** — completely ambiguous, no clear key center, deeply mysterious.
- **Diminished scale** — symmetrical and unresolved, creates an investigative, searching quality.
- **Minor pentatonic with added chromatic notes** for a more blues-influenced mystery.

### Chord Qualities and Progressions
- **Minor 7th chords** and **half-diminished (m7b5) chords** — unresolved and searching.
- **Tritone-based intervals** in the melody against sustained bass notes.
- **Chromatic mediant relationships** — moving between chords whose roots are a 3rd apart with at least one chromatic note (e.g., C major to Eb major). Unexpected and disorienting in a captivating way.
- **Unresolved cadences** — the dominant 7th that doesn't resolve is one of the most reliable suspense-building devices in music.
- **Sparse voicings** with wide intervals create harmonic openness that feels questioning.

### Tempo
- 60–100 BPM. Slower tempos sustain tension; too fast and the energy tips into action rather than mystery.
- Silence and space between phrases are essential — what isn't said is as important as what is.

### Key Choices
- **A minor, D minor** — common centers for mystery due to their neutral, adaptable quality.
- **No strong tonal center** — modal or atonal writing that resists obvious key assignment.
- Mid-register is often most effective — neither the weight of low register nor the clarity of high register.

### Rhythm Patterns
- Sparse and unpredictable. Long notes, unexpected rests, isolated single notes.
- Subtle ostinato figures — a quiet, repeated pattern that creates unease without becoming overt.
- Pizzicato strings, solo woodwind lines, isolated piano notes.

### Harmonic Rhythm
- Very slow and deliberate, with sudden unexpected moves. The timing of chord changes should feel slightly unpredictable — either arriving too soon or holding too long.

## Jazzy / Sophisticated / Smooth

Jazz sophistication comes from harmonic richness, rhythmic nuance, and a sense of ease — technically complex but effortlessly delivered.

### Scales and Modes
- **Dorian mode** is the backbone of jazz minor tonality — smooth, slightly melancholic but never heavy.
- **Mixolydian mode** for dominant chord contexts — bluesy, relaxed, sophisticated.
- **Lydian dominant** (Lydian with b7) is the jazz composer's secret weapon — simultaneously bright and unresolved, used over dominant 7th chords.
- **Bebop scales** (major or dominant bebop scales add chromatic passing tones to keep the chord tones on the beat).
- **Whole tone and diminished scales** for altered dominant contexts.

### Chord Qualities and Progressions
- **Major 7th, minor 7th, dominant 7th, and extended chords** (9th, 11th, 13th) are the vocabulary of jazz harmony.
- **ii – V – I** is the foundational jazz progression. In major: Dm7 – G7 – Cmaj7. In minor: Dm7b5 – G7alt – Cm(maj7).
- **Tritone substitutions** — replacing a dominant chord with one whose root is a tritone away (e.g., Db7 substituting for G7).
- **Chord extensions and alterations**: b9, #9, b13 on dominant chords for sophistication and tension.
- **Turnarounds** and **reharmonization** — jazz thrives on unexpected but logical harmonic substitutions.

### Tempo
- Wide range depending on style: ballads at 50–70 BPM, medium swing at 120–160 BPM, up-tempo at 200–300 BPM.
- **Swing feel** — the subdivision between beats is uneven (long-short) rather than even, giving jazz its characteristic lilt.

### Key Choices
- **Bb major, Eb major, F major** — traditional jazz keys because many horn instruments are transposing instruments in Bb or Eb.
- **C major and G major** for piano-centric or guitar jazz contexts.
- **Ab major** — has a particular richness favored in ballads.

### Rhythm Patterns
- **Swing subdivision** — the defining rhythmic characteristic of jazz.
- **Comping patterns** (chordal accompaniment with rhythmic interest) rather than steady strumming or blocked chord patterns.
- **Syncopation and anticipation** — chords often land slightly before or after the beat.
- **2 feel vs 4 feel**: bass playing on beats 1 and 3 (2 feel) for a relaxed quality, or all four beats (walking bass, 4 feel) for more drive.

### Harmonic Rhythm
- Often fast — jazz standards frequently change chords every one to two beats. This density of harmonic movement is part of what creates the sophisticated, active quality.
- Ballads slow this down to one chord per bar or two, letting each extended harmony breathe.

## Nostalgic / Bittersweet

Nostalgia occupies a specific emotional space: it's not pure sadness or pure happiness, but a blend of warmth and longing. The past was good; the present is the loss of it.

### Scales and Modes
- **Dorian mode** is ideal for bittersweet — it's minor but with a raised 6th that introduces warmth and light into the darkness.
- **Major scale with modal borrowing** — a piece primarily in major that borrows chords from the parallel minor (e.g., using the iv chord in a major key).
- **Mixolydian** for a laid-back, reminiscent quality without full sadness.
- **Major pentatonic** for a simpler, folk-influenced nostalgia.

### Chord Qualities and Progressions
- **The IV – I deceptive resolution** — moving to the subdominant instead of the tonic delays resolution and creates wistfulness.
- **vi – IV – I – V** and its variations — the vi chord's minor quality introduces shadow into an otherwise bright major progression.
- **Borrowed iv chord in major** (e.g., Fm in C major) — one of the most reliable nostalgia-inducing moves in music.
- **Major 7th chords** — warm, extended, slightly unresolved.
- **The I – V – vi – iii – IV progression** with its descending bass line creates a sense of inevitability and longing.
- **Plagal cadences** (IV – I) feel old, hymn-like, and emotionally warm in a nostalgic way.

### Tempo
- 70–100 BPM. Unhurried, but not so slow as to feel heavy. A walking pace, like someone slowly revisiting memories.

### Key Choices
- **G major, D major** — warm, open-sounding keys associated with folk and acoustic music carry inherent nostalgic associations.
- **C major** in its simplest form — the key of childhood songs and beginner piano pieces has a nostalgic resonance.
- **A major** on acoustic guitar has a particular warm, nostalgic quality.

### Rhythm Patterns
- **Simple, regular patterns** — steady quarter notes or eighth notes in the accompaniment, like a comfortable heartbeat.
- **Acoustic textures**: fingerpicked guitar, simple piano patterns, light percussion.
- 3/4 waltz time has strong nostalgic connotations — the rhythm of old dances and lullabies.
- Gentle, lilting 6/8 for a folk-influenced nostalgic feel.

### Harmonic Rhythm
- Moderate — roughly one chord per bar. Regular enough to feel familiar and comfortable, with occasional held chords for emotional emphasis.

---

## Triumphant / Epic / Heroic

Triumph is about earned resolution — the sense that difficulty has been overcome. Epic music amplifies this into something larger-than-life. The theory choices signal strength, inevitability, and grandeur.

### Scales and Modes
- **Major scale** — clean, unambiguous, and resolved. Triumph requires clarity.
- **Mixolydian** for a slightly more rugged, heroic quality (the flat 7 suggests strength without refinement).
- **Major pentatonic** for anthemic, universally accessible heroic themes.
- **Lydian** for an otherworldly, soaring quality in fantasy or sci-fi heroic contexts.

### Chord Qualities and Progressions
- **Major triads in root position** — no inversions, no extensions. Root position major triads are pillars.
- **I – V – I** with a strong, full cadence. Resolution after struggle.
- **IV – I** (plagal cadence) used at climactic moments for a broad, affirmative quality.
- **bVII – IV – I** — the borrowed flat VII into IV into I is a quintessential epic rock and film score move.
- **I – IV – V** with brass voicings and wide spacing.
- **Modal mixture**: starting in minor and arriving in major — the classic "from darkness into light" arc.

### Tempo
- 100–130 BPM. March-like tempos in this range feel powerful, organized, and forward-moving.
- Slow tempos (60–80 BPM) can be used for a more ceremonial, majestic quality.
- Very fast tempos in 4/4 create an action-oriented heroism (battle music).

### Key Choices
- **D major, C major, Bb major, Eb major** — big, bright keys that orchestras and brass sections favor.
- **D major** in particular has a strong association with heroic and triumphant themes in the orchestral tradition.
- High register and full orchestral range. Wide dynamic range — the contrast of quiet buildup to full triumphant statement is essential.

### Rhythm Patterns
- **Dotted rhythms** (long-short patterns) are historically associated with grandeur and martial energy — the "French overture" style.
- **Strong downbeat emphasis** — beats 1 and 3 hit hard.
- **March rhythms** in the percussion — steady, organized, purposeful.
- **Fanfare-style melodic rhythms** — dotted 8th and 16th note patterns in the melody.

### Harmonic Rhythm
- Moderate and predictable — one to two chords per bar with strong, clear changes. The listener should always know where they are harmonically. Ambiguity undermines triumph.

---

## Peaceful / Calm / Meditative

Peaceful music minimizes tension, maximizes consonance, and creates a sense of spaciousness and stillness. The goal is to lower the listener's arousal and induce a state of rest.

### Scales and Modes
- **Major scale** in its simplest, most consonant applications.
- **Pentatonic scales** (major or minor) — the absence of half-steps eliminates all dissonance and creates an inherently open, calm quality.
- **Dorian mode** for calm music with a slight introspective quality — not heavy, just still.
- **Lydian mode** for a peaceful quality with an element of beauty and wonder.

### Chord Qualities and Progressions
- **Open voicings** — chords with wide spacing that let overtones ring clearly and without tension.
- **Major add9 and sus2 chords** — neither fully resolved nor dissonant, simply open.
- **I – IV – I** movement that creates gentle motion without drama.
- **Pedal tones** — a sustained tonic in the bass under slowly shifting upper harmonies.
- Avoid tritones, minor 2nds, and diminished chords entirely.
- **Drones** — a single sustained note or chord (common in meditative and world music traditions) eliminates harmonic movement and creates stillness.

### Tempo
- 50–80 BPM. Slow enough to feel restful, aligned with resting heart rate.
- In meditative contexts, even slower or no discernible tempo at all (free, sustained tones).

### Key Choices
- **C major, G major, D major** — clear, uncomplicated keys without a heavy signature.
- On guitar: open tunings (DADGAD, open G) create natural resonant drones perfect for peaceful music.
- Mid to high register, with light touch in the low end to avoid heaviness.

### Rhythm Patterns
- **Regular, gentle patterns** — steady 8th note arpeggios, soft fingerpicking.
- Minimal or no percussion. If percussion is present, soft brushed snare, light shaker, or soft mallets on hand drums.
- Long, sustained tones in the melody. Slow vibrato.
- **Even, unhurried subdivision** — no syncopation, no rhythmic surprises.

### Harmonic Rhythm
- Very slow — one chord every two to four bars, or even longer. Static harmony is inherently calming. The less harmonic movement, the lower the emotional tension. Let chords ring and decay naturally before moving to the next.

*These mappings describe general tendencies and common practices, not rules. The most powerful emotional effects often come from intentional deviation — a single minor chord in an otherwise bright major piece, a sudden moment of silence in a wall of aggressive sound. Use this map as your starting point and let the music tell you where to go.*
